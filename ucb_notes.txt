- Bumping activity remains the same
- uncheckedEnqueue function is same
    calls are mostly the same, there's one extra in propagate() in glucose (line 1001) that's called when propagating
    binary clauses and it no longer has the one in implies() in minisat

	however there are two versions, a simpleUncheckEnqueue and the regular uncheckedEnqueue. Former is in lcm.cc - what
	does it do? these are the only relevant writes to assigns[] though, + the initialisation, so the same spots as in
	minisat will work here - aside from simpleUncheckEnqueue

	I'm just gonna chuck it in lcm.cc right now and see what happens, I'm not sure what that simple functions are doing
	yet
- pickBranchLit
	there's some points about randomizing on restarts
	otherwise it's basically the same

- TODOs:
	- What is the lcm.cc/simple approach? Is that preprocessing? - this is main concern - yes it is preprocessing
	- Randomise first descent or no (I've left at no, probably ineffectual)
