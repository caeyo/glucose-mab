Two decay params here:
- var_decay is applied as usual
- But there is a max_var_decay now
- They start var_decay at 0.8, max_var_decay at 0.95. Then, during search(), if a conflict is found, following code is run
            if(conflicts % 5000 == 0 && var_decay < max_var_decay)
                var_decay += 0.01;
	- So they're starting decay more aggressive and reducing it over time to max_var_decay
- There is also an adaptSolver() that is applied during a search if a conflict is found, following code is executed
            if(adaptStrategies && conflicts == 100000) {
                cancelUntil(0);
                adaptSolver();
                adaptStrategies = false;
                return l_Undef;
            }
	- adaptStrategies initialised to true in solver config (opt_adapt). So I guess this is applied once then turned off
  In it, it messes with var_decay and max_var_decay. Check the method for specifics, there's three cases

Aside from considering decay val carefully, lsids changes should be easy to apply
